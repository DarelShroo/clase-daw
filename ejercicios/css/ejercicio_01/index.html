              <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
              <p>
                You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days, we
                will charge the credit card you used when you sign up. If you
                choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your card
                will not be charged.

              <h3>What is a “Financial Account”?</h3>
              <p>
                Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense items
                that can be used for tracking or reporting purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                They're designed to be flexible and can be used to differentiate
                between bank accounts, companies, individuals or between
                personal and business entries.

              <h3>Will I be able to cancel my account if | don’t use Pulse?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes - you can cancel your account at any time. To cancel your
                account, go to your billing page and click on “Please cancel my
                account” at the bottom of the page. The account owner is the
                only one who can cancel an account. An email request to delete
                an account is not considered cancellation.

              <p>
                Brand new accounts are the only ones eligible for a 30-day free
                trial. If you upgrade an existing account, your credit card will
                be billed the new amount on the date of your next billing cycle.

              <p>
                No. There is no contract when you use Pulse, other than agreeing
                to our Terms of Service.
